# E-commerce-Data-Analytics
This project aims to take a closer look on the sales data of a e-commerce platform in order to evaluate which areas could be further optimized.

There are 2 modules:
- accessing_database.py file contains sqlite codes used to access, select, join and aggregate the tables inside the database file into a pandas dataframe
- Data_Cleaning_Visualization.py file contains matplotlib and seaborn codes to generate various types of charts for better ease of analysis

The complete analysis, findings, and suggestions can be found in this Medium article: https://medium.com/@evelyn.eve.9512/e-commerce-data-analytics-becfe4abe966
